# Introduction to Python

## Python Basics
Python was conceived by Guido Van Rossum.
It is considered as a general purpose programming language.
It is open Source.
It is easy to build Packages in Python and there is already a very rich library present for almost everything.
Python shell is a place where you can type Python code and immediately see the results. 
IPython (Interactive Python) was created by Fernando PÃ©rez and is part of the broader Jupyter ecosystem.
The other option is to create a script and execute that .py file.


Comments in python is denoted by # symbol (in vs code shortcut ctrl+/)

### Variables
In python we need not explicitly state the type when creating variables.
Variable names are case sensitive
type() function: to check the type of variable created

A string is Python's way to represent text.
You can use both double and single quotes to build a string.

The Boolean is a type that can either be True or False.

Python + symbol demonstrates operator overloading by adding the values if used between numeric values, and concatenation if the types are strings.
Type CConversion methods: int(),str(),float()and, bool()
